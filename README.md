# Timers:
If you wish to change the waiting time, go to the `sh_config.js` file and you can find a variable called `WaitTime` under both the `Revive` & `Respawn` commands:
- line 11 for the revive waiting time.
```javascript
  WaitTime: 240, // The default wait time the player has to wait before they can use the command // TIME IN SECONDS \\
``` 
- line 26 for the respawn waiting time.
```javascript
  WaitTime: 120, // The default wait time the player has to wait before they can use the command // TIME IN SECONDS \\
``` 
- line 27 for the auto respawn waiting time. _(when the script is toggled off)_
```javascript
  AutoRespawnTimer: 10, // this will be the wait time for auto respawn when the script is toggled off using the command or in line No.2
``` 
keep in mind, setting a lower number could decrease the effectiveness of its purpose, and setting a higher number could make players bored.
